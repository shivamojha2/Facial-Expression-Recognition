# Facial-Recognition-Keras

This repo contains a CNN build and trained in keras to recognize facial expressions.

The dataset used is the FER 2013 dataset. It consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. The objective is to classify each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression into one of seven categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral).

After training and saving the model, it is served directly to a web interface to perform real-time facial expression recognition on video and image data.

Note: The training and test data, along with the sample videos are not added to the repository.
